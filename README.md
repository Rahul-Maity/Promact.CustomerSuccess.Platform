## About this solution

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the ABP Framework. All the fundamental ABP modules are already installed. 

### Pre-requirements

* [.NET 8.0+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
* [Node v18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Configurations

The solution comes with a default configuration that works out of the box. However, you may consider to change the following configuration before running your solution:

* Check the `ConnectionStrings` in `appsettings.json` files under the `Promact.CustomerSuccess.Platform` project and change it if you need.

### Before running the application

#### Generating a Signing Certificate

In the production environment, you need to use a production signing certificate. ABP Framework sets up signing and encryption certificates in your application and expects an `openiddict.pfx` file in your application.

This certificate is already generated by ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to generate it yourself. However, if you need to generate a certificate, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -v -ep openiddict.pfx -p a2a5a8af-14c6-4374-a8f3-908165814c47
```

> `a2a5a8af-14c6-4374-a8f3-908165814c47` is the password of the certificate, you can change it to any password you want.

It is recommended to use **two** RSA certificates, distinct from the certificate(s) used for HTTPS: one for encryption, one for signing.

For more information, please refer to: https://documentation.openiddict.com/configuration/encryption-and-signing-credentials.html#registering-a-certificate-recommended-for-production-ready-scenarios

> Also, see the [Configuring OpenIddict](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Deployment/Configuring-OpenIddict#production-environment) documentation for more information.

#### Install Client-Side Libraries

Run the following command in the directory of your final application:

```bash
abp install-libs
```

> This command installs all NPM packages for MVC/Razor Pages and Blazor Server UIs and this command is already run by the ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to run this command manually.


### How to Run

The application needs to connect to a database. Run the following command in the `Promact.CustomerSuccess.Platform` directory to migrate the database and seed the initial data:

````bash
dotnet run --migrate-database
````
This command will create and seed the initial database. Then you can run the application with any IDE that supports .NET.

### How to Run frontend 

Navigate to the frontend directory:

````bash
cd projectname/frontend
````
Install dependencies:
````bash
npm install
````

Start the Angular development server:
````bash
ng serve
````
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to access the application.

2. **Locate** and click on the `"Create project"` button.
3. **Fill in** the required details:  `"Project name"`,  `"Project Details"`,  `"Project manager"`
4. After filling in the details, **submit** the form to create the project.

### Viewing Project Details
1. Once a project is created, its details will be displayed in a table below.
2. **Locate** the project in the table to view its details.

### Entering Project Section
After locating the desired project in the table, **click** on its name, You will be directed to the section dedicated to that particular project, where you can perform further actions or view additional details related to the project.

### Particular project page

### Creating project details 
- You will be directed to the section dedicated to that particular project, where you can find forms organized in multiple tabs for creating details specific to the project.
- Upon creating project details, the updated information is displayed below the form in a tabular format after refreshing the page.
  
### email notification 
- In this project, multiple stakeholders can be added for a particular project using the form in tabs. A feature allows sending email notifications to all stakeholders.
- After any form submission, stakeholders added to the project receive real-time emails to keep them updated on any project changes. 
    
### export pdf
- On this page, users can access an `"Export PDF"` button. Clicking it allows them to download an offline copy of the project details, facilitating easy access and reference outside the online environment.

## Technology Used

### Frontend
- Angular
- TypeScript
- Angular Material UI

### Backend
- [ABP.IO](https://abp.io/)
- C#

This project leverages Angular and TypeScript for frontend development, alongside the Angular Material UI library for enhanced user interface components. On the backend, it utilizes the ABP.IO framework, implemented using the C# programming language.

## Third-party Integrations
- Implemented "`Auth0 authentication"` for seamless login and logout functionalities. Utilizing the single-page application (SPA) architecture, users can securely access the system, enhancing both user experience and data security.

### Deploying the application

Deploying an ABP application is not different than deploying any .NET or ASP.NET Core application. However, there are some topics that you should care about when you are deploying your applications. You can check ABP's [Deployment documentation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Deployment/Index) before deploying your application.
